Welcome to PXNG-Free-TweakS Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm PXNG, and it's my dream to become an IT professional when I grow older. I've always been passionate about computers, and I love finding ways to make PCs run faster and smoother.

This repository is a collection of tweaks, guides, and tools Iâ€™ve created to help people improve their PC performance. Whether you're a gamer, streamer, or just someone looking to optimize your setup, I hope you find these resources useful.

I may be young, but I know more than the average person my age when it comes to PCs, and Iâ€™m constantly learning and improving. I made this repository not just to share my knowledge but to help others unlock the full potential of their machines. ðŸš€

Why I Made This My goal is to make performance optimization accessible to everyone, regardless of their skill level. Iâ€™ve seen so many people struggle with slow PCs, and I want to share what Iâ€™ve learned to make a difference.

Feedback and Suggestions Iâ€™m always open to feedback! If you have any suggestions or ideas, feel free to let me know. Together, we can make this repository even better.

Connect with Me If you like what you see or want to learn more, feel free to join my Discord server (if you have one) or share this repository with others who might benefit.
